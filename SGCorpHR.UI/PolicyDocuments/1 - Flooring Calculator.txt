Find Cost of Tile to Cover W x L Floor
Difficulty: 1

Ask the user to enter in a width, length and the cost per 1 unit of flooring. Have the program calculate how much it would cost to cover the area specified with the flooring.

Tips
-------------------------------
This is a relatively simple program. Be sure to first find out how much area the floor is and then multiply that by the cost per unit of flooring. Start with some simple numbers that you can quickly calculate in your head. Try a 10 x 10 ft room with each unit of flooring costing $1.00.

Added Difficulty
-------------------------------
Figure out how much labor costs would be given that the average flooring team can only put in 20 square feet of flooring per hour at a cost of $86.00/hr with a 15 minute billing increment.
