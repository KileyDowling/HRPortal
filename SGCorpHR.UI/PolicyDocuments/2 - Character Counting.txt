Character Counting
Difficulty: 2

Make a program which asks the user to enter in a string and then prints out how many vowels are in that string. For example, the user enters “hello world” and it returns “There are 3 vowels in ‘hello world’”.

Tips
-------------------------------
Strings are typically thought of and used as an array of characters. If you can loop through these characters one by one, you can compare them to a list of vowels. If you find one that matches, increment a counter variable. After the loop is done, the counter will then contain your count.

Added Difficulty
-------------------------------
Count the consonants as well as spaces. Provide a mini report of all these counts.
